## Application Architecture (MVVM)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1622/1*5b-8CCT6MvQrWrep4aQUIw.png)  
With Firebase interacting with repository, the application is designed in a way to be scalable, any backend can be Swapped in future without much changes in codes, be it
AWS, Room, Retrofit, Mongo the application will run smoothly.
With MVVM unit testing also becomes easier (However due to time constraints unit testing has not been performed in this app)
